# ResearchReading
I started to use this repository as my notebook to store some learning/paper reading notes from Feb. 2022.
This is learned from some other system researchers. Much thanks and respect to them!
It is a good way to visualize my work per day and gets positive feedback.
Also, you can try to use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/). It is fascinating.
